# Use '#' to define single line comments
# 
# Declare variables as such:
# 
# VariableName = Value 
# 
# or if you want to include spaces, surround in quotation marks:
# 
# "My Variable Name" = "My Variable"
# 
# To include Quotation marks within a variable or name, put 
# a backslash directly before them: 
# 
# Name = "James \"Jimmy\" Jones"
# 
# If you wish to end a string with a backslash, go to the next line 
# without adding a final quotation mark 
# 
# If you wish to declare a variable with an array of associated values: 
# 
# myArray = [ 
#     "First Value"
#     "Second Value"
# 
#     ...
# 
#     "Final Value"
# 
# ]
