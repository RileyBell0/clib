 // TODO 
  Make sure all realloc calls happen on allocated memory

  // TODO
  make sure realloc is called wherever possible -> it may not move memory which
  is way faster, as such if memory isnt moved, we should make some changes
      // TODO
        One of these changes should be in the circular array file, where
        the smaller piece of memory (starting chunk or ending chunk) should be moved
        but thats a pipe dream

// TODO
  Verify strings work if you do string_make(NULL) etc
  TODO 
    should you be able to write to a null string?
    and if so, should you use the small str buffer or should it use allocated memory?
